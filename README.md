# Final_lecture_DB
My database lecture's final term project
This's my database lecture's final-term project. It requires designing a database for a store (i choose a Nike store) in 3NF, then inserting records into each table 
with large number. It has tables describing products detaily, table for supplier, shipment, bills, bill details. I used Java and JDBC to insert records automatically. 
If you have any comments or question, please feel free to ask. Thank you =)))
